# Experimental Physics Data Processing Pipeline

## Overview
This repository contains two main components designed to enhance data processing and analysis in experimental physics: the **Tracking Pipeline** and the **Trigger Detection Pipeline**. Each component addresses specific challenges in the field, leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to improve the efficiency and accuracy of data interpretation.

## Components
- **tracking-GNN**: The GNN for track reconstruction from particle collision data. Includes training, inference, and track building scripts.
- **trigger-detection**: Implements an explainable end-to-end pipeline for trigger detection using Bipartite Graph Networks with Set Transformers. Also includes code for baseline models.

## Getting Started
To utilize these pipelines, navigate into the respective directory (`tracking-GNN` or `trigger-detection`) and refer to the README.md for detailed instructions on environment setup, training models, and running inferences.
